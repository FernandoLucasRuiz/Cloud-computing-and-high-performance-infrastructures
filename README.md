# Cloud-computing-and-high-performance-infrastructures 

This repository is part of the coursework for the "Cloud Computing and High Performance Infrastructures" module, offered in the Master of Bioinformatics program at the University of Murcia. The course provides a comprehensive introduction to the use of cloud computing and high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructures in bioinformatics.

The module covers various aspects of cloud computing and high-performance computing technologies that are crucial for tackling large-scale computational problems in the field of bioinformatics. Students learn to deploy and manage computational resources effectively to perform high-throughput data analysis.

In this repository you can find all the autonomous work derived from the course.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the fundamentals of cloud computing and high-performance computing.
- Gain practical skills in managing and scheduling jobs on HPC clusters using SLURM.
- Develop proficiency in using containers and environment managers like Docker and Singularity for reproducible research.
- Learn to use Git for version control and collaboration in software development projects.
- Explore various cloud platforms and services to perform scalable bioinformatics analyses.

## Technologies Used

- **SLURM**: Job scheduling system for Linux clusters that allows for the allocation of exclusive and/or shared compute resources.
- **Python**: Programming in Python on multi-node clusters to handle parallel computations.
- **Git**: Essential for version control and collaborative development.
- **Docker**: Software platform for building, running, sharing, and managing containers.
- **Singularity**: Container platform optimized for HPC and compute-driven workflows, commonly used in clusters.
- **Cloud Platforms**: Utilization of cloud services (AWS, Azure, GCP) for deploying scalable bioinformatics applications.
